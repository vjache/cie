# Changelog

All notable changes to CIE (Code Intelligence Engine) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.9] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Callsite line numbers** — `cie_trace_path`, `cie_find_callers`, and `cie_find_callees` now show where each call occurs in the caller function (e.g., `[called at search.go:163]`). The `cie_calls` schema gains a `call_line` column populated by all three parsers (Go, Python, JS/TS). Requires re-indexing to populate callsite data.
- **`include_code` parameter for `cie_find_type`** — When `include_code=true`, the tool JOINs with `cie_type_code` and returns the full source code of the type (interface methods, struct fields). Eliminates the need for a follow-up file read.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate results in `cie_find_callees`** — Phase 1 (direct call edges) and dispatch phases (2/2b/3) could return the same callee, causing duplicates. Added `filterAlreadySeen` semantic dedup by callee name across phases.
- **Param dispatch fan-out in `cie_find_callees`** — `FindCallees` now applies the same source-code-based method filter as `cie_trace_path`, reducing noise from unrelated interface methods.

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.13.0.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Parser self-name-match bug** — When a method calls another method with the same simple name through a field (e.g., `EmbeddedQuerier.Query` calling `q.backend.Query()`), the call was silently dropped because the parser detected it as a self-call. The `else if` structure in the parser meant the unresolved call path was unreachable when the simple name matched. This was the **root cause** of `cie_trace_path` failing to cross interface chains — functions like `EmbeddedQuerier.Query` had zero call edges in the index.
- **BFS visited map blocking alternate paths** — `cie_trace_path` could only find one path to each target. When a test implementation reached the target at depth 2, the `visited` map blocked the real production path at depth 3. Target nodes are now checked before being marked as visited, allowing `max_paths` to return genuinely different paths.
- **Field dispatch fan-out** — Interface and concrete field dispatch (Phases 2/2b) returned ALL methods of field types instead of just the called method. Now reads the function's source code from the index and filters to only methods that appear in `.MethodName(` patterns. For `EmbeddedQuerier.Query`, this reduces results from 17 to 1.

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.12.0.
- Extracted `getCalleesViaFields`, `appendFilteredCallees`, `processGoCallExpression`, and `addUnresolvedCall` helpers to reduce cognitive complexity.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **`cie_trace_path` now crosses multiple interface boundaries** — The core tracing bug: parameter-based dispatch (Phase 3) was skipped when a method already had callees from direct calls or field dispatch. This prevented tracing chains like `Store → storeNode → storeFact → Client.StoreFact → Writer.StoreFact → Execute` where the path crosses two interface boundaries. Phase 3 now always runs.
- **Test mocks excluded from interface dispatch** — All interface dispatch queries in `cie_find_callees` and `cie_trace_path` now filter out implementations defined in `_test.go` files. Previously, `MockQuerier.StoreFact` appeared alongside `Client.StoreFact`, adding ~50% noise to results.
- **External stub validation failure** — Synthetic stub functions for external types (e.g., `sql.DB.Query`) had `StartLine=0, EndLine=0`, which failed the entity validator during indexing. Now set to valid placeholder values.
- **Incorrect `cie reset --force` in error messages** — Error messages and documentation recommended the non-existent `--force` flag. Corrected to `cie reset --yes`.

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.11.0.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Concrete field method dispatch** — Call graph now resolves method calls through concrete-typed struct fields (e.g., `b.db.Run()` where `db` is `*CozoDB`). Previously only interface-typed fields were resolved. Works at both ingestion time and query time in `cie_find_callees` and `cie_trace_path`.
- **External type stubs** — When a struct field references an external type not in the index (e.g., `sql.DB`, `http.Client`), CIE generates synthetic stub entries so the call graph shows the dependency boundary rather than silently dropping the edge.
- **Embedded interface resolution** — `BuildImplementsIndex` now resolves embedded interfaces (e.g., `ReadWriter` embedding `Reader` + `Writer`) by inheriting methods from embedded types. Includes a stdlib fallback map for common interfaces (`io.Reader`, `fmt.Stringer`, etc.).
- **Parameter-based dispatch in `FindCallees`** — `cie_find_callees` now resolves interface calls through function parameter types, matching the existing behavior of `cie_trace_path`.
- **Fan-out reduction** — Parameter-based dispatch in `cie_trace_path` now filters results to only include methods that match direct callees, preventing BFS explosion when an interface has many implementations.
- **Type suggestion in `FindFunction`** — When `cie_find_function` returns no results, it checks if the name matches a type and suggests using `cie_find_type` instead.

### Changed
- `resolveToImplementations` renamed `interfaceType` parameter to `fieldType` since it now handles both interface and concrete types.
- MCP server version bumped to 1.10.0 with updated tool descriptions.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Case-insensitive function matching** — `cie_find_function` and `cie_trace_path` now match function names case-insensitively when `exact_match=false`. Searching `runquery` now finds `CozoDB.runQuery`.
- **"Did you mean?" suggestions** — When `cie_trace_path` can't find a target, source, or waypoint function, it suggests similar function names with file locations instead of a bare "not found" error.
- **`cie_find_by_signature` tool** — New MCP tool to search functions by parameter type or return type. Useful for discovering all functions accepting a specific interface or struct (e.g., `param_type="Querier"` finds all functions taking a `Querier` parameter).

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.9.0.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Standalone function interface dispatch** — Interface calls in non-method functions are now resolved. Previously, calls like `client.StoreFact()` inside `func storeFact(client Querier, ...)` were invisible because the resolver only inspected struct fields. Now parses function signatures to match parameter names against callee prefixes and resolves through `cie_implements`.
- **Query-time dispatch fallback** — For indexes built before this release, `cie_trace_path` and `cie_find_callees` resolve interface calls at query time by parsing function signatures. No re-indexing required for basic functionality.
- **Interface boundary detection** — When `cie_trace_path` fails to reach a target, it now detects interface boundaries and reports which interface types blocked resolution, with actionable suggestions (`cie_find_implementations`, re-index).
- **Waypoint support for `cie_trace_path`** — New `waypoints` parameter chains BFS segments through intermediate functions (`source -> wp1 -> wp2 -> target`). Reports which segment failed when a waypoint chain breaks.
- **`pkg/sigparse` package** — Dependency-free Go function signature parser, shared by both ingestion and trace subsystems to avoid import cycles.

### Changed
- `CallResolver.resolveInterfaceCall` now tries field-based resolution first (existing behavior), then falls back to param-based resolution for standalone functions and method params.
- MCP server version bumped to 1.8.0.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Cross-package interface dispatch** — Field types with package qualifiers (e.g., `tools.Querier`) now correctly match against interface names in `cie_implements`. Previously, `cie_field` stored `tools.Querier` while `cie_implements` stored `Querier`, breaking the join for cross-package references.
- **Chained field access resolution** — Calls like `s.querier.StoreFact()` are now resolved correctly. Previously the resolver split on the first dot, confusing the receiver variable (`s`) with the field name (`querier`).
- **Overly broad type matching in dispatch queries** — `starts_with(callee_name, "Client")` no longer matches `ClientPool.Get`. Uses `concat(impl_type, ".")` for exact type prefix matching.
- **Trace partial path reporting** — When `cie_trace_path` fails to find a path, it now shows the deepest partial path explored with file:line locations, helping diagnose where the trace got stuck.
- **mergeQueryResults dedup** — `FindCallees` interface dispatch results were silently dropped because dedup used only column 0 (`caller_name`, same for all rows). Now uses composite key of all columns.

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.7.1.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Interface dispatch resolution** — Call graph now resolves calls through interface-typed struct fields. When a struct holds an interface field (e.g., `Writer`), CIE traces through to the concrete implementations, dramatically improving call graph completeness for dependency injection patterns.
- New `cie_field` relation storing struct field names and types.
- New `cie_implements` relation mapping concrete types to interfaces via method set matching.
- `BuildImplementsIndex` in ingestion pipeline matches method sets against interface declarations.

### Changed
- `FindCallers`, `FindCallees`, and `TracePath` now include interface dispatch edges in results.
- `CallResolver` falls back to interface dispatch when direct call resolution fails.
- MCP server version bumped to 1.7.0.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **MCP server instructions for AI agents** — CIE now sends comprehensive usage instructions during the MCP `initialize` handshake. Any AI agent connecting via MCP automatically receives guidance on tool selection, recommended workflows, common parameters, and mistakes to avoid — without requiring a CLAUDE.md or external documentation.

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.6.0.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Embedded CozoDB mode for MCP server** — `cie --mcp` now reads directly from the local CozoDB database at `~/.cie/data/<project>/` without requiring an HTTP server or Docker infrastructure.
- New `EmbeddedQuerier` type in `pkg/tools/client_embedded.go` implementing the `Querier` interface for direct local database access.
- Auto-fallback in MCP server: when `edge_cache` is configured but unreachable and local data exists, automatically switches to embedded mode with a warning.
- `isReachable()` and `hasLocalData()` helper functions in MCP server for intelligent mode detection.

### Changed
- **Docker is no longer required** — CIE now works fully standalone with just the `cie` binary.
- Default `edge_cache` configuration is now empty (`""`) — embedded mode is the default.
- `mcpServer.client` field changed from `*tools.CIEClient` to `tools.Querier` interface for dual-mode support.
- `IndexStatus` tool function now accepts `Querier` interface instead of `*CIEClient`.
- `cie init -y` now generates config without `edge_cache` set (embedded by default).
- Quick Start simplified from `init → start → index` to `init → index`.

### Removed
- `cie start` and `cie stop` commands (Docker lifecycle management).
- Embedded `docker-compose.yml` from the binary.
- Docker auto-detection probe in `cie index` (`isCIEServerAlive` at localhost:9090).

### Fixed
- Indexing now succeeds without Ollama running — metadata (functions, types, calls) is written, empty embeddings are gracefully skipped.
- MCP server no longer hangs when configured `edge_cache` is unreachable.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- New git history MCP tools (v1.5.0):
  - `cie_function_history`: Get git commit history for a specific function using line-based tracking.
  - `cie_find_introduction`: Find the commit that first introduced a code pattern (git pickaxe).
  - `cie_blame_function`: Get aggregated blame analysis showing code ownership percentages.
- `GitExecutor` helper in `pkg/tools/git.go` for safe git command execution with timeout support.
- Git repository auto-discovery from config file location.

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.5.0.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker image tags to include `v` prefix (e.g., `v0.4.7`) matching CLI version.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-23

### Changed
- `cie start` now pulls latest Docker images before starting containers.
- Docker image tag now matches CLI version (e.g., `v0.4.6` instead of `latest`).
- Setup container now uses `docker compose run --rm` for cleaner execution.

### Fixed
- Fixed `cie start` hanging on first run when downloading embedding model.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Added QEMU setup to Docker build workflow for proper ARM64 CGO compilation with tree-sitter.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed tree-sitter parser not being used on ARM64 Linux (Docker on Apple Silicon). Previously always fell back to simplified parser which extracts ~40% fewer functions. Now tries tree-sitter first.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker container unable to access project files for indexing (missing `/repo` volume mount in embedded docker-compose.yml).
- `cie init` now defaults `edge_cache` to `http://localhost:9090` (Docker mode) instead of leaving it empty.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- Incremental indexing: only process changed files since last indexed commit.
- Uses `git diff --name-status` to detect added, modified, deleted, and renamed files.
- Added `cie_project_meta` table for storing project metadata (last indexed SHA).
- New methods in EmbeddedBackend: `GetProjectMeta`, `SetProjectMeta`, `GetLastIndexedSHA`, `SetLastIndexedSHA`, `DeleteEntitiesForFile`.
- Integration tests for incremental indexing.

### Changed
- Default indexing behavior is now incremental when possible (git repo with previous index).
- Use `ForceReindex: true` in config to force full re-indexing.

### Fixed
- Fixed `cie index` running locally instead of using Docker server when `cie init` was run before `cie start`.
- `cie index` now auto-detects running CIE server at `localhost:9090` even if `edge_cache` is not set in config.
- `detectDockerCompose` now checks `~/.cie/docker-compose.yml` in addition to the project directory.

### Documentation
- Clarified that `cie serve --port 9090` can be used to serve local data on the same port as Docker, enabling MCP tools to work with locally indexed data without reconfiguration.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker container not reading project config by mounting `.cie/` directory.
- Pass `CIE_PROJECT_ID` and `CIE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variables to Docker Compose.

- New `cie stop` command to stop Docker containers (preserves data).
- New `cie reset` command to delete indexed data with `--docker` flag for full cleanup.
- Automatic detection of Docker-based CIE server during `cie init` and command execution.
- Persistence of server URL in `.cie/project.yaml` via `edge_cache` field.
- Static linking for CozoDB library in `Makefile` for better portability on macOS/Linux.
