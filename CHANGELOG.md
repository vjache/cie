# Changelog

All notable changes to CIE (Code Intelligence Engine) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed `cie init` not setting `edge_cache` URL when Docker server is starting but not yet responding.
- Auto-detect `docker-compose.yml` with CIE server configuration and default to `http://localhost:9090`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- New `cie start` command to automate Docker infrastructure setup and model pulling.
- New `cie stop` command to stop Docker containers (preserves data).
- New `cie reset` command to delete indexed data with `--docker` flag for full cleanup.
- Automatic detection of Docker-based CIE server during `cie init` and command execution.
- Persistence of server URL in `.cie/project.yaml` via `edge_cache` field.
- Static linking for CozoDB library in `Makefile` for better portability on macOS/Linux.
- Thread-safety fixes for parallel indexing (Tree-sitter parser pool and CallResolver locks).
- Homebrew tap support: `brew install kraklabs/cie`.
- GitHub Actions release workflow with multi-platform binaries (linux-amd64, linux-arm64, darwin-arm64).

### Changed
- Improved `cie init` flow to suggest `cie start` as the next step.
- Simplified `README.md` and documentation with the new `init` -> `start` -> `index` workflow.
- Updated `install.sh` with the new workflow instructions.
- Client-server architecture: CLI delegates to Docker-based CIE server for heavy operations.

### Fixed
- Fixed critical `SIGSEGV` and `semawakeup` crashes on macOS/Darwin when running indexing.
- Fixed `concurrent map read and map write` panics during large codebase indexing.
- Fixed volume permission issues in `docker-compose.yml`.
